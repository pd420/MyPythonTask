# MyPythonTask

#Task 1) 
            Go through some of the other in built functions in python


# Task 2) 
            # given a string for example
            str1 = "Welcome to python"
            # check if "to" is present in "welcome to python"
            

# Task-3)
            Go through other inbuilt methods like remove(),count(),clear(),sort(),reverse()
            
            

# Task-4)

            2 problems!

       a)   #Add item 70 after 60 in the following Python List
            #input
            l1 = [10, 20, [30, 40, [50, 60], 80], 90, 100]
            #output
            [10, 20, [30, 40, [50, 60, 70], 80], 90, 100]


       b)   #add sublist [7,8]
            #input
            l2 = [1,2,[3,4,5,6],9]
            #output
            [1,2,[3,4,5,6,[7,8]],9]


#Task 5)

            dict1 = { 
               "april_batch":{ 
                  "student":{ 
                     "name":"Mike",
                     "marks":{ 
                        "python":80,
                        "maths":70
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
            From the above dictionary, do the following tasks

                access "Mike"
                access 80
                change "Mike" to "Your name"
                add ML = 80 and DL = 80 inside marks
                
                
#Task 6) 

             Add and remove the elements from a tuple. (Refer workaroud to modify the tuples)


#Task7)     
            Go through other inbuilt methods like
                        
             1) difference() ,
             2) symmetric_difference()


#Task8)
             Make a table of all the In-built data structures and Point out the differences one by one
             
             
#Task9)

            1) Ask 2 numbers from users and store it in num1 and num2
            
            2) Ask user to press 1 for addition,2 for subtraction,3 for multiplication and 4 for division based on number given by user do the
               
               math operation.
